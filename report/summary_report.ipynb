    "When you look at a new comic book character, do you naturally assume good or evil based on that character's traits? Are most of the characters with green faces, or red eyes likely to be evil? These questions lead us to think about how we can predict whether a character is good, bad or neutral. In this report, we are going to study some of the key features of [comic book characters](https://github.com/rudeboybert/fivethirtyeight/tree/master/data-raw/comic-characters) from [Marvel Wikia](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Marvel_Database) and [DC Wikia](https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/DC_Comics_Database), and construct statistical models to predict the character alignments."

Within the dataset, there are 13 different features and total 23272 comic book characters. The percentage of missing cells is a bit high and around 21%. Table 2 below describes the summary statistics regarding our data set. Since a considerable amount of the raw data contains missing values, this prompted a deeper investigation into each feature. Below in Table 2, we investigate each feature separately which showcases the count of unique observations and missing value percentage for each feature. The feature gsm(sexual minority) has the largest missing percentage which is around 99%, so we will drop this feature. Also, every observation in name is unique, it would be good to add different features concerning name.\n",

    "\n",
    "During the analysis phase, a number of different classification models were trained to predict the characters output alignment, and a model using the Random Forest Classification methodology was found to score the highest mean validation accuracy of .589 with over a 95% confidence interval compared to other model scores. Given this result, the RandomForestClassifier model will be the model chosen for further optimization through hyperparameter tuning.\n",

    "### Feature Transformation and Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle null feature values, we imputed the features with small null value proportions with the median for the numeric columns and the most frequent value for the categorical features. For the `gsm` and `first_appearance` features, we found that the data was too sparse to be of much value and decided to drop them to reduce unnecessary dimensions. The imputation step produced a higher validation accuracy score of approximately 1-2% across all models. This higher score was greater than 2 standard deviations of the test score for each trial (with imputed and with null), so we felt comfortable moving forward with imputed values as opposed to dropping null values for the columns chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the lone numerical feature, `appearances`, a scaler was applied to normalize the values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next steps to improve the model through feature transformation and encoding will be more aggressive feature engineering to create more powerful features. The key will be to use our intuition to use what we know of the comic book industry and cultural trends in general to select key features. Some areas of interest might be to transform `appearances` feature into a weighting modifier, and to bin the year values into discrete decades.\n"

Use machine learning feature elimination techniques and reporting to determine how effective the features currently available are and provide a feedback mechanism to iteratively improve feature creation.\n",
