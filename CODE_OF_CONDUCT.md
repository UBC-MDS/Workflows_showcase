### Introduction
For DSCI 522-Data Science Workflows project, we are committed to creating a friendly and respectful place for learning, teaching and contributing. 
All participants in our project are expected to be respectful and considerate to others.

To make clear what is expected, everyone participating in Group 25 is required to conform to the Code of Conduct. 

### The DSCI 522 Group 25 Code of Conduct
For group project, we are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. As such, we do not tolerate behaviour that is disrespectful to anyone. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment based on characteristics that include, but are not limited to, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, citizenship, nationality, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief (or lack thereof), membership of a national minority, property, age, education, socio-economic status, technical choices, and experience level.

Everyone who participates in Group 25 activities is required to conform to this Code of Conduct. It applies to all spaces managed by Group 25 including, but not limited to, zoom meetings, email communication, and online forums such as Slack and GitHub. The group members are expected to assist with the enforcement of the Code of Conduct. 

#### Expected Behavior

All participants in our events and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others. All interactions should be professional regardless of platform: either online or in-person. In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment we encourage the following kinds of behaviours in all Group 25 events and platforms:

- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism
- Focus on what is best for the community
- Show courtesy and respect towards other community members
- Be extra regimented in our use of process.


#### Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior by group participants at any event/platform include:

- written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of any specific group
- causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation
- violent threats or language directed against another person
- the display of sexual or violent images
- unwelcome sexual attention
- nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact
- sustained disruption of talks, events or communications
- insults or put downs
- sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes
- excessive swearing
- incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm
- continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop
- publication of private communication without consent

#### Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Participants who are asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately. This applies to any Group 25 events and platforms, either online or in-person. Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with the Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that deem offensive, or inappropriate.
