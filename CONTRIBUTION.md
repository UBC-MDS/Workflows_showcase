# Feedback and Contribution

Welcome all the contributors\! Please share your input, feedback, and

You can open up an `issue` here as well to discuss any issues, bugs, or

## How Do We Contribute

The contributors will use a Fork-Pull Request workflow on GitHub to
share input, feedback, and contributions. Each of the contributors are
required to fork the main repository under the UBC-MDS organization, and
then send the contributions from the forked repository to the main one
as a pull request. Another team member from Group 25 will review and
accept the pull request.
